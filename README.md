COVID-19 Tracking Germany  Data profiling and visualization



Project Description

The COVID-19 pandemic, which is a still ongoing global pandemic of coronavirus disease, Which Start in 2019. At the end of 2019, the world first faced with these new challenge. The novel (new) virus was first identified in Wuhan, China; in December 2019. After that it managed to spread world wide, which also include Germany.

we have a datasets (three) containing information about the infection cases, deaths and number of vaccinated in Germany.

For our project work we have chosen this data and Now see what we can retain from it.

Environment Setting

    Python : Version 3.8.8 is used. Along with following library
        Pandas : The data analysis library
        Numpy : math and array support for analysis
        Matplotlib : Data visiualization library
        seaborn : Data visualization
        plotly : Secified data visualization
        Pandas_profiling : Data profiling library
        geopandas : geo data visualization
        And some other library for minor role like string, unicodedata etc.
